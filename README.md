# HoloLens with Leap Motion controller

This is a project combining a Leap Motion controller with the HoloLens. The goal is to enable the development of improved gesture based interaction systems for the Hololens.

## Requirements

The Leap Motion client requires the [Orion SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to run. The Skin Detection Trainer only requires OpenCV to run.
